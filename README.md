* Daniel (dmilith) Dettlaff (dmilith [at] verknowsys.com). I'm also on #freebsd and #scala.pl @ freenode IRC.


## Contributors:
* Micha≈Ç (tallica) Lipski.


## Dependencies:
* [Qt4 4.8.x](http://qt-project.org/downloads) (only QtCore part)


## Features
* Integrates with [Sofin](http://verknowsys.github.io/sofin)
* Support software igniters written in JSON (+comments support) to generate predefined (user or system wide) software configurations on the fly.
* Support for software hooks. (More in [Defaults.json](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/Default.json)). Hook example:

```json
    "install": {
        "commands": "sofin install mysoft; install my software plugin",
        "expectOutput": "Success happened, and this output is a confirmation",
        "expectOutputTimeout": 0
    },
```

* Using kernel file watchers (kqueue on OSX & BSD, epoll on Linux) to watch software config/ data dirs.
* Supports "touch .hookname" method of manual launching of hooks. (for example: touch ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/.install will invoke install hook of MyApp igniter definition.)
* Supports basic hook dependency model. (for example: touch ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/.start will invoke: install hook, configure hook, validate hook and start hook of MyApp igniter definition)
* Supports software hook expectations with error reporting through ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/.errors file.
* Supports software "baby sitting". By default watches for software pid ("alwaysOn" option in [Defaults.json](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/Default.json))
* Supports software TCP server checking. ("watchPort" option in [Defaults.json](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/Default.json))
* Supports free port checking for TCP services, automatically generates random port for new services, (but also supports "staticPort" option in [Defaults.json](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/Default.json)), to provide static port binding for software. (for example staticPort is 80 for Nginx). By default, service ports are stored in ~/SoftwareData/AppName/.ports and reused on next software start.
* Supports service autostarting. You need only to touch ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/.autostart file.
* Is designed to work with user privileges as a little user side daemon.
* Uses almost no memory: ~5 MiB RSS on 64bit system when working with several services.
* Supports super user mode, to support root services (ports: 1-1024). Just run svdss as root and that's it.
* Should be system agnostic. I didn't try windows, but it should work after few minor changes.
* Supports state files. For example if process is running the lock file is created: ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/.running
* Supports unified process configuration model. By default ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/service.pid and ~/SoftwareData/MyApp/service.log are created for each software.
* Supports dynamic, live log level change invoked by touch ~/.log-level, where "log-level" is one of: error, info, debug, trace. By default log level is info.
* Supports auto igniter reload support on hook level. You don't need to update, sync or reload igniters. After change, next hook invoke will use latest version of software igniter by default.
* Supports multiple directory sources for igniters. Default order of checking igniters existance for regular user is: ~/Igniters/Services, then /Users/Common/Igniters/Services. For root it's: /Users/Common/Igniters/Services, then /SystemUsers/Igniters.
* Supports igniter constants, auto filled before invoke of each hook. Currently there are:

```sh
SERVICE_PREFIX # by default: ~/SoftwareData/AppName
SERVICE_DOMAIN # default host domain name. It's stored in ~/SoftwareData/AppName/.domain file by default.
SERVICE_ADDRESS # by default it's default host IP address
SERVICE_ROOT # by default: ~/Apps/AppName
SERVICE_VERSION # by default taken from Sofin's: ~/Apps/AppName/appname.version
SERVICE_PORT # by default: random port, stored in ~/SoftwareData/AppName/.ports
```

* Tested in production environments.


## Igniter examples:
* [Redis](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/Services/Redis.json)
* [Mysql](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/Services/Mysql.json)
* [Nginx](https://github.com/VerKnowSys/TheSS/blob/master/basesystem/universal/RootServices/Coreginx.json)


## WTF? How to run it?

```sh
# to build svdss:
bin/build
# On Darwin it may ask for sudo password to invoke bin/ignitersinstall
# which installs required igniters to /Users/Common (/home/Common on Linux)

# on Linux, run as root:
bin/ignitersinstall

# and now just:
./svdss
# (it supports -d param for explicit debug output and -t for trace level output)

# on second terminal, do:
mkdir ~/SoftwareData/Redis && touch ~/SoftwareData/Redis/.start
# wait a while, software install process should work in background
# (requires Sofin to be already installed!). This process has
# own log file here: ~/SoftwareData/Redis/.output. Software should
# pick random port, generate configuration for Redis service and
# just start it.
```
