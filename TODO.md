## TODO list (in order of importance):
* Internal/ External networks support (VPN/ Internet)
* Auto scaling support (distributed architecture support)
* Coreginx/ Nginx watchers + Nginx config generation (on the fly)
* Add support for TheSS configuration (get rid of a couple of hardcodes, f.e.: Shell path)
* Implement software conflict check before run (error notification when f.e. Ruby is a requirement of service1 and Ruby19 is a requirement of service2)
* Multiple domains for one service support
